# two pointers
Here by two pointers, I mean put two pointers at the both ends of the list, and move towards the other. Normally in this scenario, the list is sorted. For instance, one typical problem two pointers can solve is finding target sum in a sorted list.

Reasons why two pointers is correct and efficient is, by comparing sum against target sum and moving one pointer, it eliminates pairs that are invalid or worse.
